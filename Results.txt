Classes Modified:

BankSim2.java (note, rather than modifying BankSim.java, I simply copied it and then edited the copy, so it is now BankSim2.java. If you are testing the code, please make sure you change references to BankSim.java to reference BankSim2.java. Thank you!)

Modified all methods besides printList(). See BankSim2.java for details.

Event.java

Modified getWhichQ() - uncommented it

Modified setWhichQ() - uncommented it and changed it from q being either 0 or 1 to q being either 1 or 2.

RunBankSimRandom.java

Modified main() - set “to generate a random collection of 160 customers with start times randomly chosen between 1 and 400 and durations randomly chosen between 2 and 8 time units,” as instructed. (And fixed it to reference BankSim2.java, instead of BankSim.java.

Departure.java

Modified the constructor to include “	this.whichQ = arr.getWhichQ();” which uses the variable whichQ from the Event.java class.
